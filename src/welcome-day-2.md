# Welcome to Day 2

Now that we have seen a fair amount of Rust, today will focus on Rust's type
system:

 * Methods - associating functions with types
 * Traits - behaviors shared by multiple types
 * Generics - parameterizing types on other types
 * Standard library types and traits - a tour of Rust's rich standard library
 * A deep dive on the `Iterator` trait

And finish up with some topics relating to building large-scale software in
Rust:

 * Modules and visibility
 * Testing
