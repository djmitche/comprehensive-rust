# Welcome to Day 1

This is the first day of Rust Fundamentals. We will cover a lot of ground
today:

* Basic Rust syntax: variables, scalar and compound types, enums, structs,
  references, functions, and methods.

* Control flow constructs: loops, conditionals, and so on.

* Types and type inference

* Pattern matching: destructuring enums, structs, and arrays.

<details>

Please remind the students that:

* They should ask questions when they get them, don't save them to the end.
* The class is meant to be interactive and discussions are very much encouraged!
  * As an instructor, you should try to keep the discussions relevant, i.e.,
    keep the discussions related to how Rust does things vs some other language.
    It can be hard to find the right balance, but err on the side of allowing
    discussions since they engage people much more than one-way communication.
* The questions will likely mean that we talk about things ahead of the slides.
  * This is perfectly okay! Repetition is an important part of learning. Remember
    that the slides are just a support and you are free to skip them as you
    like.

The idea for the first day is to show the "basic" things in Rust that should
have immediate parallels in other languages. The more advanced parts of Rust
come on the subsequent days.

If you're teaching this in a classroom, this is a good place to go over the
schedule. We suggest splitting the day into two parts (following the slides):

* Morning: 9:00 to 12:00,
* Afternoon: 13:00 to 16:00.

You can of course adjust this as necessary. Please make sure to include breaks,
we recommend a break after every exercise, and covering the exercise results
after the break.
