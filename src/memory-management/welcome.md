# Welcome to Day 3

Today, we will cover some more advanced topics of Rust:

* Memory management, lifetimes, and the borrow checker: how Rust ensures memory safety.

* Developer Conveniences: functionality to make you happier and more productive with Rust.

* Slices: references to ranges of memory.

* Error handling: panics, `Result`, and the try operator `?`.

* Unsafe Rust: raw pointers, static variables, unsafe functions, and extern
  functions.
