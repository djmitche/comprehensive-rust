# Before Merging:
* Remove the timing / existing-content information from view
* Remove cr2-organization/

# Plans for Later:

## High Priority

* Address slides that are too large for the aspect ratio, either by breaking
  them up, shrinking them down, or some other creative solution.

## Other Fixes

* Can the segment headers (src/segname.md) be auto-generated, or done with a
  macro? (#1415)
  * Can these include timing information
  * Can the per-day and overall-course sections also include timing info?

* Can CI detect deletion of a slide without corresponding book.toml entry?
  (#1417)
* Simplify the GUI exercise (methods-and-traits)
* Better examples for trait-bounds and impl trait, since students haven't yet
  seen std traits
* Traits slide should mention associated types, trait parameters, trait
  "inheritance"
* Improve iterator example (per suggestions from reader)
* Modify `Interior Mutability` to use Mutex instead of Cell/RefCell, as noted
  in the comment in that file.
* Replace the health-statistics exercise, which really has little to do with
  borowing. Maybe something that tempts students to use &mut self at the same
  time as an exclusive reference to a field of self?
* Talk about `ref` and `mut` modifiers in pattern matching
* Add "recaps" at the beginning of each day
* "9.5. Type Aliases: The example shows how to declare, but on how it looks in
  practice is not clear enough (there is a use of one type alias but it's
  hidden in a complex type). Ideally I would add some function signatures or
  custom structs that showcase the cleanliness of this." (@deavid)
* Cover trait objects after memory management, since they require some
  understanding of Box.
